	  <p>Jesse Keskinen is a Finnish Visual and Fine artist living in Finland. He talks fluent Finnish and English. &nbsp;
	  He is most himself with strong depictions and themes. He takes great pleasure in creating worlds and characters and bringing them to life and giving them souls. In search of deeper purpose, he's on a constant journey seeking to improve himself and trying his hand in new, exciting things, all the while dreaming of drawing himself a friend. He graduated as a Visual and Fine Artist from Lapland University of Applied Sciences in May 2023. </p>
    </div>
	
<p>His top area of choice is 2D illustrating, but his arsenal includes experience from several fields such as photography, 3D modelling, media- and video art, concept art, comics and animation.</p>
<p><b>He is a philosopher, author and artist.&nbsp; A visualist, worldbuilder and storyteller.&nbsp;</b></p>
	
	
<p><b>Artist statement:</b> <i>"I create art first and foremost to make sense of my own self and the world around me. There's much I can't make sense of, and much more I don't understand, and art is my attempt in bridging the chasm between me and the other world which I am an outcast of." </i> </p>
